## Phase 1: Data Extraction
- Utilizing GSM Arena website to extract smartphone data.
- Extracted information includes network compatibility, launch date, body dimensions, display specifications, platform details, memory capacity, camera features, sound output, communication capabilities, additional features, battery type, and miscellaneous details.

## Phase 2: Database Design
### Database Design:
- Identified main entities such as brands, models, and specifications.
- Determined relationships between entities.
- Defined specific data attributes to be stored for each entity.
- Employed normalization techniques to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity.
### Database Technology Selection:
- Selected a suitable Database Management System (DBMS) like MySQL based on scalability and performance requirements.

## Phase 3: Statistical Analysis
- Conducted statistical analysis to address various questions and hypotheses using the extracted data.
- Utilized descriptive statistics to gain insights into the dataset.
- Formulated and tested hypotheses related to smartphone characteristics.

## Phase 4: Power BI Dashboard
- Developed visualizations and a logical dashboard using the constructed database.
- Designed meaningful charts and graphs to represent key insights from the data.

## Phase 5: Machine Learning

In this phase, we apply machine learning to the smartphone specifications dataset from GSMarena to derive insights and predictions. We focus on three key questions:

1. **Market Segmentation**: Utilize clustering to segment the smartphone market based on specifications, revealing emerging trends and consumer segments.

2. **Brand Classification**: Classify smartphones into brands using classification algorithms, analyzing brand preferences and market dynamics.

3. **Price Prediction**: Develop a model to predict smartphone prices based on specifications, exploring regression algorithms and feature importance analysis.

These tasks aim to provide actionable insights for stakeholders in product development and marketing strategies.
